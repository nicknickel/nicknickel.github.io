    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>After all, fitness is just a measure of ability for some purpose. You can work on your fitness as a father, your fitness as a vaccuum salesman, or your fitness to dig ditches. Furthermore, the principles that the fitness world has studied, and continue to study, can be extracted and implemented into any fitness measure.</p>
<p><strong>Key Truth</strong></p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t get better at something unless you train what you aren&rsquo;t yet good at. Nor will you stay good at something unless you review what you can do. This is the bread and butter of physical fitness. You train your muscles to become better at a given movement or routine, whether that&rsquo;s break them down and heal or to improve their performance. Once those muscles are good at the given movement, you move on or move up.</p>
<p>The same strategy can and should be applied to any area of fitness in which you wish to progress. If you desire to improve your ability to play the piano, you train your fingers and brain on a song you don&rsquo;t know and might be at the edge of your ability. You work at it until you are good at that song, then you move on or move up. If you want to improve your ability to paint, you train by painting something you see that you&rsquo;ve never painted before. You paint things like it until you&rsquo;re good at painting that thing, then you move on or move up.</p>
<p><strong>The Why</strong></p>
<p>Growing in the Kingdom of God is hard. It takes work and intention. No one accidentally becomes good at reading and memorizing scripture or intercessory prayer; what does being &ldquo;good&rdquo; at those things even mean? If you&rsquo;re going to say yes to Jesus, you have to put down your preference and comfort and get to work. Paul calls it dying to oneself. Jesus calls it taking up your cross.</p>
<p>I created the Spiritual Fitness plan because I was tired of knowing what I should be better at but never practicing it and never progressing. Much like someone who needed a radical change for weight loss, I was in need of a radical change in the congruence between what I believed and what I did.</p>
<p>I put some polish on the plan and published it here with the hope that others would benefit from it as well. If you get to the end of this post and know that you need to start doing or get better at the disciplines outlined in the plan, I encourage you to try it out. If you struggle with what to do for your daily time with the Lord, I think this plan might help.</p>
<p><strong>The Breakdown</strong></p>
<p>The plan is inspired by physical fitness plans. Your muscles start to adapt to a movement after 3 to 6 weeks so typical physical fitness plans change the routine at that interval. Your muscles and nervous system need a rest period after several weeks of abuse. The spiritual fitness plan follows these same principles. There is a 3 week routine followed by a &ldquo;rest&rdquo; week. This happens 3 times to complete a 3 month plan. This routine is hard. I couldn&rsquo;t complete it the first time I tried. It&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s physically or mentally impossible but, if you aren&rsquo;t used to the practices in the routine, the motivation to continue can be difficult.</p>
<p>To make this successful, don&rsquo;t:</p>
<ul>
<li>skip days</li>
<li>go out of order</li>
<li>switch out practices for other ones</li>
<li>do less than the minimum time indicated</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these shortcuts will help your spiritual muscles improve. The plan is designed to include variety so if there are some things you like more than others, you won&rsquo;t get &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; doing things you don&rsquo;t like (unless you don&rsquo;t like any of it). If you completed the plan and it was not easy or you couldn&rsquo;t finish but you want to run it again, I recommend waiting a week or two before starting another round.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t go into detail on each individual practice in this post but intend to do a deeper dive on each one and why it&rsquo;s in the plan. They are fairly obvious in terms of their Biblical origin. The practices are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Silence and solitude</li>
<li>Singing and music</li>
<li>Study Bible</li>
<li>Bible Meditation</li>
<li>Communion</li>
<li>Intercessory prayer</li>
<li>Repentance and Confession</li>
<li>Fasting</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Finish Line</strong></p>
<p>Doing this routine will not get you to heaven. It won&rsquo;t force your problems to go away. It won&rsquo;t make God bless you. It&rsquo;s a tool that will allow God to work on your heart, grow your relationship with Him, increase your capability in the disciplines, and help you discover what you are capable of. Remember that you aren&rsquo;t perfect and God knows this. If you miss a day or stop altogether, God won&rsquo;t be disappointed. He will be proud of your effort and heart to pursue Him.</p>
<p><strong>Particulars On This Printout</strong></p>
<p>Each phase of the program has a dedicated page. Go through each phase alphabetically. This results in a 3 month program. There is also a legend to help understand each of the disciplines and how to practice them. Each schedule indicates a duration for the practice. This is a minimum suggestion. Each practice can go for longer but don&rsquo;t go for less time. Set a timer and push yourself to go the full duration. If you follow the minimum duration, no day will take longer than 30 minutes. If you want a longer duration, double the indicated time for each discipline. Each phase is designed around a 5 day work week and a 2 day weekend where unique and shorter activities occur on the weekend. With that understanding, the schedule can be adjusted to fit weekly calendars that fall outside of this structure.</p>
