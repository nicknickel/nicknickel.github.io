<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this, chances are you&rsquo;ve all heard about fasting, maybe even tried it. Do you remember the last time you fasted? Was it last month, or last year? A few years ago?</p>
<p>The technical definition of <em>dietary</em> fasting is voluntary reduction or elimination of your intake of food for a specific time and purpose. <em>Biblical</em> fasting can be defined as voluntary abstainment from something for a specific time and purpose. This discussion is about Biblical fasting. The Bible talks about fasting with regard to food, so that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll focus on here. One can fast something other than food but abstaining from food is a very easy way to accomplish the purpose of a fast and is universal to all humanity.</p>
<p><strong>The Why</strong></p>
<p>For starters, it&rsquo;s not just fasting, it&rsquo;s prayer and fasting. I&rsquo;ve heard it said that fasting without prayer is just a bad diet. The Spirit lives in an atmosphere where prayer is and prayer changes our hearts, joining it to the Father. You&rsquo;re fasting so that you get a clearer view, so you get a breakthrough in your own understanding. It&rsquo;s not to manipulate God to action (more on that later). Fasting aligns us to His will and purposes. It&rsquo;s about faith rising up and seeing what you are supposed to see.</p>
<p>Fasting also bring discipline in your life. It is training that helps you suppress the desires and motives of your carnal man and increases the strength of your spirit man. This is profoundly beneficial. Fasting gets you to live by the Spirit; and life in the Spirit is what we should ache for. This is part of what Galatians 5:24-25 is talking about: &ldquo;Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.&rdquo; Jesus in Matthew 16 said that &ldquo;If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>An important distinction</strong></p>
<p>God is not healing your loved one because you fasted for 2 weeks. He heals your loved one because He sent Jesus Christ to die on the cross and raised Him from the dead. Fasting when a loved one is sick is to get a clearer perspective of the sickness versus the finished work of Christ. The Spirit empowers you to see the situation through Christ and minister the proper authority necessary. You&rsquo;re fasting so that you get a clearer view.</p>
<h3 id="why-its-important--what-are-the-benefits">Why it&rsquo;s important / What are the benefits</h3>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t an exhaustive list but indicates several reasons why we should fast. Credit should be given to Todd Blansit as this list was taken from one of his talks.</p>
<ol>
<li>Initiate personal revival and spiritual growth. - <strong>Joel 2.12</strong> &ldquo;Even now, declares the Lord, return to me with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>2.Receive clear revelation and direction from God. - <strong>Acts 13:1-3</strong> &ldquo;Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch) and Saul. While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, &ldquo;Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.&rdquo; So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and sent them off.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Free people from spiritual bondages. - <strong>Mark 9.28-29</strong> After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, &ldquo;Why couldnâ€™t we drive it out?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;This kind can come out only by prayer.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Push back or loosen the demonic powers over a situation. - <strong>Daniel 10</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Navigate the journey ahead with confidence. - <strong>Ezra 8.21-23</strong> There, by the Ahava Canal, I proclaimed a fast, so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask him for a safe journey for us and our children, with all our possessions. I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the road, because we had told the king, &ldquo;The gracious hand of our God is on everyone who looks to him, but his great anger is against all who forsake him.&rdquo; So we fasted and petitioned our God about this, and he answered our prayer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deepen our intimacy with Jesus. - <strong>Matthew 9.14-15</strong> Then John&rsquo;s disciples came and asked him, &ldquo;How is it that we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?&rdquo; Jesus answered, &ldquo;How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="why-its-in-the-spiritual-fitness-plan">Why it&rsquo;s in the spiritual fitness plan</h3>
<p>Jesus is talking in Matthew 6:16 where it says (emphasis mine), &ldquo;<em>When</em> you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.&rdquo; He goes on to describe more but I wanted to highlight that it doesn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;if&rdquo; you fast, it says &ldquo;when&rdquo;. Fasting is an expectation from Jesus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my belief that Christians should fast often. That is to say, they should fast more than once a year when the pastor calls the whole church to fast. If fasting trains your spirtual muscles to follow God and aligns you with His heart and purposes, the only question to answer is &ldquo;how bad do you want those things?&rdquo;. My answer to that question is, &ldquo;as often as possible&rdquo;. If you believe that life on earth is meaningless without God and you don&rsquo;t want to live your life without Him, that is probably your answer too.</p>
<h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h3>
<p>The spiritual fitness plan prescribes a sunup to sundown fast once every four weeks. I like the sunup to sundown fast because it&rsquo;s difficult but you can still eat. It seems like a smart way to incorporate a fast into daily life. On a personal note, I&rsquo;ve found that at the end of a sunup to sundown fast, I&rsquo;m desperate for food. It&rsquo;s difficult to think about other things. It&rsquo;s in those moments that I direct my desperation toward God. I engage with the Lord and show Him that my desperation for Him is like the way I&rsquo;m feeling toward food. I&rsquo;ve got a deep hunger for more of Him and I feel the hunger in a very tangible way. It&rsquo;s an incredibly bonding moment between He and I. My prayer is that the same thing happens between you and Him.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s situation is different and the sunup to sundown prescription won&rsquo;t work for a lot of people. I encourage you to be honest and eager in your fast selection. Sunup to sundown may be too easy for some people, it may be unwise for others. <strong>Push yourself but don&rsquo;t break yourself.</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, you can&rsquo;t fail your fast. If you stop earlier than you wanted or break down and eat something, you didn&rsquo;t fail. It&rsquo;s not about works at the cost of condemnation. You cannot be condemned for breaking a fast. The Lord excited that you are pursuing Him, He&rsquo;s not disappointed.</p>
