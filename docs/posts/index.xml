      <description>After all, fitness is just a measure of ability for some purpose. You can work on your fitness as a father, your fitness as a vaccuum salesman, or your fitness to dig ditches.

You won&amp;rsquo;t get better at something unless you train what you aren&amp;rsquo;t yet good at.</description>
