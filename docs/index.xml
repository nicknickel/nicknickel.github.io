      <description>After all, fitness is just a measure of ability for some purpose. You can work on your fitness as a father, your fitness as a vaccuum salesman, or your measure of ability to dig ditches. Furthermore, the principles that the fitness world has studied, and continue to study, can be extracted and implemented into any fitness measure.
Key Truth
You won&amp;rsquo;t get better at something unless you train what you aren&amp;rsquo;t yet good at.</description>

      <description>Illustration from Victor Hugo et son temps (1881)   The Hunchback of Notre-Dame (French: Notre-Dame de Paris) is a French Romantic/Gothic novel by Victor Hugo, published in 1831. The original French title refers to Notre Dame Cathedral, on which the story is centered. English translator Frederic Shoberl named the novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame in 1833 because at the time, Gothic novels were more popular than Romance novels in England.</description>
