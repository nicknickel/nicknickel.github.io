### Intro

If you're reading this, chances are you've heard about fasting, maybe even tried it. Do you remember the last time you fasted? Was it last month, or last year? A few years ago?

The technical definition of _dietary_ fasting is voluntary reduction or elimination of your intake of food for a specific time and purpose. _Biblical_ fasting is a little different. Biblical fasting can be defined as voluntary abstinence from some thing for a specific time and purpose. This post is about Biblical fasting. The Bible talks about fasting with regard to food, so that's what I focus on. One can fast something other than food but abstaining from food is a very easy way to accomplish the purpose of a fast and is universal to all humanity (everybody eats).

**The Background**

When the Bible talks about fasting, it's connected to two contexts. The first is the old testament instruction to fast on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur). This fast was preparation for atonement and forgiveness. The second is a voluntary response to some event; something like a plague or hurricane. Notice that both of these contexts prompt a fast *as* as response, not *for* a response.

In today's culture, the most common view for the purpose of fasting is to gain some benefit. Better health, suppression of sins, spiritual growth, answer to prayer, that kind of thing. The smart people call this the Instrumental view. When you compare this approach to the purposes behind fasting in the Bible they don't exactly line up, which leads to another approach the smart people call the Responsive view. The Responsive view starts with an event (i.e. death, war, hurricane, etc) and views fasting as - you guessed it - a response to that event. This seems to line up more with how the Bible prompts fasting. Remember that according to the Bible we fast *as* a response and not *for* a response.

This second view is not how I was raised to approach fasting. Fasting can be a powerful tool for spiritual growth and a closer relationship with the Lord and is crucial way for a follower of Jesus to align themself with the Lord. This approach leans toward the Instrumental view as one is fasting *for* a closer relationship with the Lord but a case could be made that the fast is prompted *as* a response to our need for Him. Truth be told I'm still processing this and there is a lot more that could be said here.

Bottom line: I think a good way to think about fasting is that you're fasting so that you get a clearer view and align yourself to His perspective and purposes.

To put that in a practical example, God is not healing your loved one because you fasted for 2 weeks. He heals your loved one because He sent Jesus Christ to die on the cross and raised Him from the dead. Fasting when a loved one is sick is to get a clearer perspective of the sickness versus the finished work of Christ. The Spirit empowers you to see the situation through Christ and minister the proper authority necessary. You're fasting so that you get a clearer view.

Something that should be mentioned here is that fasting should always be coupled with prayer. I've heard it said that fasting without prayer is just a bad diet. How can your thoughts and attitudes align with the Lord's if you aren't interacting to Him?


### What the Bible has to say

This isn't an exhaustive list but indicates several reasons - according to the Bible - for why we should fast. Notice that they all align with our definition of gaining a clearer perspective of the Lord's heart and intentions and growing closer to Him. Credit should be given to Todd Blansit as most of the items in this list were taken from one of his talks.

1. Initiate personal revival and spiritual growth. - **Joel 2.12** "Even now, declares the Lord, return to me with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning."

2. Receive clear revelation and direction from God. - **Acts 13:1-3** "Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch) and Saul. While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them." So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and sent them off.

3. Free people from spiritual bondages. - **Mark 9.28-29** After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, "Why couldnâ€™t we drive it out?" He replied, "This kind can come out only by prayer."

4. Push back or loosen the demonic powers over a situation. - **Daniel 10**

5. Navigate the journey ahead with confidence. - **Ezra 8.21-23** There, by the Ahava Canal, I proclaimed a fast, so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask him for a safe journey for us and our children, with all our possessions. I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the road, because we had told the king, "The gracious hand of our God is on everyone who looks to him, but his great anger is against all who forsake him." So we fasted and petitioned our God about this, and he answered our prayer.

6. Deepen our intimacy with Jesus. - **Matthew 9.14-15** Then John's disciples came and asked him, "How is it that we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?" Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast."

8. Grow in the discipline of your physical man - This is part of what Galatians 5:24-25 is talking about: "Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit." Jesus in Matthew 16 said that "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me".

### Why it's in the spiritual fitness plan

It's my belief that Christians should fast often. That is to say, they should fast more than once a year when the pastor calls the whole church to fast. If fasting trains your spiritual muscles to follow God and aligns you with His heart and purposes, the only question to answer is "how bad do you want those things?". My answer to that question is, "as often as possible". If you believe that life on earth is meaningless without God and you don't want to live your life without Him, that is probably your answer too.


### Closing thoughts

The spiritual fitness plan prescribes a sunup to sundown fast once every four weeks. I like the sunup to sundown fast because it's difficult but you can still eat. It seems like a smart way to incorporate a fast into daily life. 

On a personal note, I've found that at the end of a sunup to sundown fast, I'm desperate for food. It's difficult to think about other things. It's in those moments that I direct my desperation toward God. I engage with the Lord and show Him that my desperation for Him is like the way I'm feeling toward food. I've got a deep hunger for more of Him and I feel the hunger in a very tangible way. It's an incredibly bonding moment between He and I.

Everyone's situation is different and the sunup to sundown prescription won't work for a lot of people. I encourage you to be honest and eager in your fast selection. Sunup to sundown may be too easy for some people, it may be unwise for others. **Push yourself but don't break yourself.**

Lastly, you can't fail your fast. If you stop earlier than you wanted or break down and eat something, you didn't fail. It's not about works at the cost of condemnation. You cannot be condemned for breaking a fast. The Lord excited that you are pursuing Him, He's not disappointed.
