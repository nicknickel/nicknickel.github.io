title: "Fitness isn't just for your body"

After all, it just means a measure of ability for some purpose. You can work on your fitness as a father, your fitness as a vaccuum salesman, or your measure of ability to dig ditches. Furthermore, the principles that the fitness world has studied, and continue to study, can be abstracted into any fitness measure.

**Key Truth**
You won't get better at something unless you train what you aren't yet good at. Also, you won't stay good at something unless you review what you can do. This is the bread and butter of physical fitness. You train your muscles to become better at a given movement or routine, whether that's to trigger their response or to improve their performance. Once those muscles are good at the given movement, you move on or move up.

The same strategy can, and should, be applied to any area of fitness in which you wish to progress. If you desire to improve your ability to play the piano, you train your fingers and brain on a song you don't know and might be at the edge of your ability. You work at it until you are good at that song, then you move on or move up. If you want to improve your ability to paint, you train by painting something you see that you've never painted before. You paint things like it until you're good at painting that thing, then you move on or move up.

**The Why**
